          <p>I&#39;m Steve. I have been developing web sites since about the time Al Gore invented the internet. My career of internet development has taken me many places. I&#39;ve met and worked with a lot of amazing and talented people over the course of my career. I started writing web pages while I was at a small startup company in Silicon Valley. It was a side thing, really. I wanted to get my feet wet and begin building what would eventually become our intranet. My love for all things &quot;web&quot; blossomed, and I eventually moved to another company where I became the &quot;webmaster&quot; for a small group of documentation developers (including myself). This thread has continued throughout my career; learning new technologies, growing my skill set in web development, architecting back-end systems, and so much more.</p>

<p>That was then. This is now... I have been at my current company for over 15 years, in a variety of positions. Continual growth has always been key to keeping up the pace with new and emerging technologies. Unfortunately, for the past few years, plain old planning and putting out fires has taken up most of my time. Very little personal development in new tech has happened and I was really missing the excitement and determination I once had for getting something new working. I missed learning enough to become pretty savvy and use that knowledge to solve a need in my organization (and personally). </p>

<p>Going back a few months, I had a great idea for a mobile app. I worked on it night after night, designing and mocking it up. Research was taking me all over the internet, and it was exciting. I saw the potential for the app, no one else had done it the way I wanted to, but there was one catch: I didn&#39;t know how to write mobile apps. So, more research ensued, and as I was just beginning to settle on a technology to learn, a very big company which I will not name (Google) beat me to the punch. Ugh, that was the end of the line for me -at least in trying to create a &quot;startup&quot; mobile app company.</p>

<p>Not giving in... Even though my idea was realized by another company who has very deep pockets, I still think that my idea is worthwhile -if not just for sheer learning and development. That&#39;s where this blog comes in. I&#39;m going to write about the process of becoming an &quot;app&quot; developer (predominantly iOS for the moment). I&#39;m going to write about my experiences of research, technology, ups when I should have gone down, lefts when I should have gone right... you should get the point by now.</p>
