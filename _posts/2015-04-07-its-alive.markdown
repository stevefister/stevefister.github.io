Houston, we have no problems! After a few hours of researching blogging platforms, I decided on [Jekyll]! It seemed the best fit for my needs during the process of learning to develop mobile apps -which is what this blog is about!

My plan is to post updates during my learning experience, in the hopes that I can save someone else time and aggravation, and give them hope. The key word here is, indeed, "hope". With my full time job and a family of five, this is going to be a huge undertaking, I hope I can make it all the way!
